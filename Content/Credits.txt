*********************************************************

A big thank you to everyone who's supported the project during these years
- it would have	never gotten to where it is now without your help.

SCP-CB has been a big collaborative effort with dozens (maybe even hundreds?)
of people creating material and giving ideas and feedback for the game, and
I'm sure I've forgotten to mention some of you here. If you've contributed
something to the game and would like your name to be added here, drop
me a message on the Undertow Games forum or contact@undertowgames.com!
